To ensure fair compensation and protect your code without resorting to unethical practices, here are some ethical ways and measures you can consider in the context of web or app development:

Clear Contracts and Agreements: Establish detailed contracts or service agreements with your clients that clearly outline the scope of work, payment terms, intellectual property rights, and ownership of the code. This helps set expectations and provides legal protection for both parties involved.

Escrow Services: Consider using escrow services or third-party payment platforms that act as intermediaries between you and the client. These services hold the payment in escrow until the agreed-upon milestones or deliverables are met. Once the client approves the work, the payment is released to you.

Licensing and Copyright: Apply appropriate licenses to your code, such as open-source licenses or custom licenses, depending on your preferences and requirements. Clearly state the ownership and permitted uses of the code within the license terms.

Watermarking and Attribution: If you are showcasing your work as part of a portfolio, consider adding watermarks or attribution to protect your intellectual property rights. This way, even if the client decides not to pay, your work will still be credited to you.

Regular Communication and Updates: Maintain open and regular communication with your clients throughout the development process. Providing updates, demonstrating progress, and seeking feedback can help build trust and ensure that the client remains engaged in the project.

Collaboration Tools and Version Control: Utilize collaboration tools and version control systems, such as Git, to track changes, maintain a history of the code, and collaborate with your clients in a transparent manner. This ensures that all parties involved have visibility into the development process.

Professionalism and Reputation: Uphold a professional reputation by delivering high-quality work, meeting deadlines, and providing excellent customer service. Satisfied clients are more likely to pay promptly and refer you to others, ensuring a sustainable business model.

Remember, its important to conduct business ethically, respecting the rights and expectations of both parties involved. If disputes or payment issues arise, it's advisable to seek legal advice or mediation rather than resorting to unauthorized access or backdoors.
