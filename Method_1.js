As a developer, ensuring payment for your work is crucial. There are several strategies you can employ to protect yourself financially, whether you're a freelancer, a subcontractor, or part of a development team.

Up-Front + Milestones: One of the most common strategies is to require some payment up-front before beginning work. Then, set up milestones where you deliver parts of the project, or show an update to progress, and the next payment is due. This provides an incentive for both you and the client. You are motivated to continue working because you won't get paid the full amount until you deliver, and the client is incentivized to pay you along the way because they won't get the full product if you stop work due to non-payment softwareengineering.stackexchange.com.
50% Up-Front, 50% Upon Completion: Another strategy is to ask clients to pay 50% up-front and 50% when the project is complete. This approach helps cover your development costs and establishes trust with the client. They will also be reassured that you won't receive your final 50% until you have delivered the completed project softwareengineering.stackexchange.com.
Document Everything: Keep detailed records of your work. If a payment dispute arises, the party with the best documentation to support their case will win. Create a document retention strategy for your development work, so you know exactly what to keep and where to put it levelset.com.

Negotiate the Contract: Set a strong foundation at the start of the project by negotiating favorable payment terms and remedies in the contract.

Submit Detailed Invoices: One of the easiest ways to get paid faster is to submit detailed invoices on time. Provide detailed, line-item descriptions of the work you’ve done and the materials you’ve used. Include any documentation that supports your invoice levelset.com.
